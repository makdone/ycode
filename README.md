## About Ycode

Ycode is a visual website builder and CMS designed for creating and managing websites without writing code. It is available as a self-hosted Open Source project or as a fully managed [Cloud][cloud] service.

## Learning Ycode

Ycode has extensive [documentation][docs]. We actively maintain and improve it, so if something is unclear or incomplete, feel free to open an issue. We welcome any feedback that helps make the docs better.

## Setting Up Ycode Open Source

To self-host Ycode you will need:

- A [GitHub](https://github.com) account
- A [Supabase](https://supabase.com) account
- A [Vercel](https://vercel.com) account

Follow the [installation instructions][install] to get started.

## Connecting AI Assistants (MCP)

Every Ycode project exposes a [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) server at `https://<your-project-domain>/ycode/mcp`. Claude, Claude Code, Cursor, ChatGPT, VS Code, and any other MCP client can read and edit pages, collections, assets, and settings through it.

Self-hosted projects are not listed in the Claude or ChatGPT connector directories, because each install has its own URL. Add your project as a **custom connector** instead:

1. In the builder, open **Settings → MCP** and copy the MCP server URL.
2. In your AI client, add a custom (remote) MCP connector and paste the URL — for example in Claude: **Settings → Connectors → Add custom connector**.
3. Connect, sign in to Ycode, and approve access.

The MCP settings page has step-by-step instructions for each client and lists the connections you have approved so you can revoke them at any time. Clients that connect from the vendor's servers (Claude.ai, ChatGPT) need a publicly reachable HTTPS URL, so deploy your project first.

## Support

We provide official support on [Ycode Cloud][cloud] projects. Community-driven support for the Open Source version is available in [Discord][discord].

## Contributing

Thank you for considering contributing to Ycode! We ask that you review the [contribution guide][contributing] before opening issues or submitting pull requests.
